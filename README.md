# Unified Matrix Factorization

The repository contains supplementary codes for the paper 'A Unified Bayesian Framework for Bi-Overlapping-Clustering Multi-Omics Data via Sparse Matrix Factorization'. 

The file generatedata.R provides code for generating data in simulations. The C files beta.cpp, count.cpp, and continuous.cpp provide steps in the Markov chain Monte Carlo updates, while the respective R files provide implementations, for the beta-valued data, sparse count data, and heavy-tailed continuous data.
